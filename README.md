tiny application to translate tropicos text format to bauble json exchange format

this is a small program, meant as a teaching/learning tool. it will also be useful in practice, but we're writing this mainly because we want to learn how to 

* write 100% unit tested code, 
* follow a single consistent coding style we all agree upon,
* publish it on github,
* translate it with gettext
* configure it on weblate
* have it automatically tested on travis-ci
* register it on coveralls.io
* use python's logging module
* configure a sentry handler for automatic error reporting
